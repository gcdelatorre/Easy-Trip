Thought for 2sHere's the prompt you can paste into a fresh v0 chat to recreate this:

**Build a landing page for "EasyTrip" - a travel planning app that generates personalized day-by-day itineraries.**

Design direction:

- Editorial, calm, premium feel. Not a typical SaaS landing page. Think travel magazine meets modern web app.
- Warm color palette: off-white/light beige background, charcoal text, muted green accent for buttons and interactive elements. No pure black and white.
- Typography: serif font for headlines (DM Serif Display), clean sans-serif for body (DM Sans). Large confident headings.
- Generous white space, soft rounded containers (rounded-2xl/3xl), subtle hover transitions on images.


Sections (in order):

1. **Navbar** - sticky/fixed. Logo "EasyTrip" on the left, nav links (Destinations, How It Works, Features) in the center, and a circular user profile/account icon button on the top right. Mobile hamburger menu.
2. **Hero** - big serif headline like "Plan your perfect trip in seconds", a short subtitle about generating complete itineraries automatically. A small subtle pill badge that says "Free to use, forever". Two CTA buttons: primary green "Start Planning" and a secondary outline "See How It Works". A staggered photo grid with real travel photography (beach, village, mountains).
3. **How It Works** - 3 steps with numbered icons (Pick destination, Set preferences, Get your plan). Clean cards with green accent icons. Keep copy minimal.
4. **Features** - bento-style grid with travel photography. Features like smart itineraries, local recommendations, and offline access. Use real images, not icons.
5. **Destinations** - heading like "Travelers love these" (not something generic like "Where will you go next?"). Grid of destination cards with overlay text (Santorini, Kyoto, Patagonia, etc.) and hover zoom on images.
6. **CTA section** -has like bg photo, full-width warm-toned banner. Mention it's completely free. Button says "Create Your Trip for Free".
7. **Footer** - clean multi-column layout. Include a subtle "Always free. No credit card needed." line. Links for company, product, legal.


Key vibes:

- Lowkey show it's free throughout (badge in hero, CTA copy, footer) without being shouty about it.
- Avoid too many em-dashes in the copy. Keep sentences clean and simple.
- All components in React .jsx files.
- Use generated travel photography, not placeholders.
